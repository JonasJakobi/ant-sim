# Ant Simulation
> Simulation of ants using Unity and C#, specifically using the C# Job System and the Burst Compiler to run huge amounts of ants in parallel.
> Mostly developed as a study for parallel processing, not very feature rich currently. 
## Features
- Random movement by ants
- Pheromone trails left by ants, followed by other ants
- Visualization tools in Unity

## Configuration
Changing the ants speeds, random rotation speed, pheromone strength etc will drastly effect the behavior of the whole swarm.
These values can be changed in the AntData and the PheromoneData in the Ants and PheromoneManager scripts.
